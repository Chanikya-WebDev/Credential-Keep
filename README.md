üí° What is Credential Keep & Why is it Valuable?
‚ùå The Problem
In today's digital world, the average person juggles dozens of online accounts for education, work, social media, and services. This leads to several significant problems:

Cognitive Overload: It's nearly impossible to remember a unique, strong password for every single service.

Password Reuse: As a result, many people reuse the same one or two passwords across multiple sites. This is a massive security risk; if one site is breached, all of their accounts are compromised.

Cross-Device Inconvenience: Accessing your accounts on a new or different device becomes a frustrating exercise of password resets and security questions.

‚úÖ The Solution: A Centralized, Secure Vault
Credential Keep directly solves these problems by providing a single, secure, and accessible source of truth for all of a user's credentials. It acts as a personal digital vault, encrypted and protected in the cloud, available on any device with a web browser.

üéì Why This Project is a Valuable Portfolio Piece
For a Computer Science student like myself in Hyderabad, this project is more than just a tool; it is a practical demonstration of my ability to design, build, and deploy a real-world, production-ready application. It showcases a range of critical skills that are highly sought after in the tech industry:

Full-Stack Development: Demonstrates proficiency in building a complete user experience, from a polished frontend with React and Tailwind CSS to a secure, scalable backend using Firebase's cloud services.

Security Architecture: Proves an understanding of secure user authentication, data isolation with server-side security rules, and best practices for handling sensitive API keys.

Modern Frontend Expertise: Highlights skills in creating dynamic, responsive, and performant user interfaces using modern tools like Vite and advanced React features like lazy loading.

Cloud & Serverless Proficiency: Shows experience with modern cloud-native and serverless architecture.

End-to-End Project Management: Mirrors a professional development lifecycle from concept and design to implementation, security hardening, and deployment.

‚ú® Key Features
This application is a full-featured credential manager with a professional feature set:

üîê Secure Multi-Provider Authentication: (Email/Password & Google)

üîó Flexible Account Management: (Account Linking, Password Changes, Forgot Password Flow)

‚öôÔ∏è Full CRUD Functionality: (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

üöÄ Enhanced Search & Filtering: (Full-Text Search & Tag-Based Filtering)

üì± Professional UI & UX: (Mobile-First Design, Modern Aesthetics, Lazy Loading)

üèóÔ∏è High-Level Architecture
The application follows a modern serverless architecture. The frontend is a single-page application built with React and Vite. It communicates directly with Google's Firebase platform, which handles all backend services:

Firebase Authentication: Manages user sign-up, login, and session persistence.

Cloud Firestore: A NoSQL database that stores the encrypted credential data, secured by server-side rules.

Vercel: Hosts the static frontend application and provides a global CDN for fast load times.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Frontend: React

Build Tool: Vite

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Backend & Database: Firebase

Icons: Lucide React

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v18 or later)

npm or yarn

A Google account to create a Firebase project

Firebase Setup
Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.

Enable Authentication Methods: Enable both Email/Password and Google.

Create a Firestore Database: Start in production mode and update the Rules.

Get Your Configuration: Create a new Web app and copy the firebaseConfig object.

Local Installation
Clone the repo:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name

Install NPM packages:

npm install

Set Up Environment Variables:

Create a file named .env.local.

Fill it with your Firebase config values, prefixed with VITE_.

Run the development server:

npm run dev

üåê Deployment with Vercel
Vercel offers a seamless way to deploy Vite applications directly from your GitHub repository.

Sign Up & Import: Sign up for Vercel with your GitHub account and import the project repository.

Configure Environment Variables: In the Vercel project settings, add all the VITE_FIREBASE_... variables from your local .env.local file. This is a critical step.

Deploy: Click the "Deploy" button.

Update API Key Restrictions: Once deployed, add your new Vercel domain (e.g., credential-keep.vercel.app) to the list of allowed HTTP referrers for your API key in the Google Cloud Console.

üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices
Environment Variables: Sensitive keys are stored locally and on the hosting provider, never committed to Git.

Firestore Security Rules: Server-side rules strictly enforce data ownership.

Restricted API Key: The Firebase API Key is restricted to only accept requests from the application's domain.
